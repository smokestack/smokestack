Smokestack
-----
  Smokestack is a modular JEE unit testing framework, independent of Java unit testing framework
  (like JUnit or TestNG) with functionality geared for validation.
  
  The idea behind this project is to provide a lightweight life-cycle management mock container 
  that is simple to use and yet provides full support for managing the life-cycle of the integration 
  components as if within the container. Simply speaking, if you are using JDBC, the jdbc module 
  within this project will ensure that all your result-sets, statements, connections and all other 
  related artifacts are in the correct state before usage and after usage. It will throw assertion 
  errors if you try to access a closed connection or if your connections are not closed properly. 
  We have tried to follow the specs as much as possible but we have also provided additional 
  convenience methods outside the specs to accomodate life-cycle state assertions. 
  
  All of the modules follow JEE specs and are written to verify that the container state is maintained 
  and that you are doing all the right things at the right places. The project is started with 
  implementing the simple cases, and intends to have a complete implementation for JEE modules included. 
  As always, if you find something that you need help with, drop us a note or you can provide your 
  own solution and we do appreciate all your comments, suggestions, feedback and improvements.
  
  Please use the unit tests under the modules to learn more about the features.

  There is no official release yet, the source can be built from the repository using
  Maven. Or snapshot jars are available at the {{{http://github.com/smokestack/smokestack/downloads}download page}}
  and at {{{http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/com/github/smokestack/}Sonatype Maven repo}}.
  
  It should be noted that this is early release, so functionality, APIs, and more are
  all subject to change (although the good news is that unit tests are easy to refactor).
